# Practices of GraphQL:

## The first part covers practices of GraphQL in express:

### There are two resources:

`author` and `book`.
A author have a list of books, a book belongs to a single author.

### By using GraphQL, querying data from resources become easy:

## The second part is a little project in folder "tiny project"

I used data from `https://countries.trevorblades.com/` and used GraphQL to query data in my javaScript files. The dropdown list has all the continents, by selecting a continent, all countries in that continent are rendered.
